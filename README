I talked with Yan, and he was ok with me releasing the functions that I
wrote for his homework, as long as I didn't release the files in which
I used these functions to solve any specific homework questions.

These functions should be useful for AST4700 taught by Dr. Yan Fernandez
or for really any arbitrary astronomy or spherical geometry application

Right now (unless I was lazy and didn't update this README) all of the
routines are in sphericaltrig.py, and have to do with spherical geometry
problems.

I will add more to this code base as the class goes on and I program more
functions.
