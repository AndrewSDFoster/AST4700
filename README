I talked with Yan, and he was ok with me releasing the functions that I
wrote for his homework, as long as I didn't release the files in which
I used these functions to solve any specific homework questions.

These functions should be useful for AST4700 taught by Dr. Yan Fernandez
or for really any arbitrary astronomy or spherical geometry application

Right now (unless I was lazy and didn't update this README) all of the
routines are in sphericaltrig.py, and have to do with spherical geometry
problems.

I just added routines for converting between ephemeri/epochs, although they are
far from comprehensive. If you are comfortable with primarily using J2000.0,
they should work fine for you. They are enough to do hw3 in Yan's class.

I will add more to this code base as the class goes on and I program more
functions.

USE AT YOUR OWN RISK, etc.
